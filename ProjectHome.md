An implementation of a BNF-like parser-generator using Lua, suitable for for low-to-medium complexity tasks (Uses built in number / string / ident matching rules, it's not possible to construct a new kind of primitive such as a regex that requires more complex lexicographical rules concerning whitespace and what not) Has a comprehensive capturing scheme which allows construction of complicated data structures with little code code other than the grammar definition itself.

Example JSON and XML parsers implemented using the code are provided with the package> That should give you an idea of what it's capable of. Parsing a non-trivial programming language with it would likely turn out to be difficult, but for handling well formatted data and small DSLs it works well.
